# Elyx Hackathon (Sloth)
This repository is our submission for the Pclub IITK X Elyx Hackathon. Here is the [problem statement](docs/Elyx%20Life%20-%20Hackathon%20Problem%20Statement%20.pdf). 

This readme is WIP and would reflect our various approaches that we take and the thought that goes behind those approaches and specifics.

## Our Goal From this Hackathon
We want to create something good, scalable and useful for this hackathon that goes a little bit beyond just the PS.
Through this process we would also learn and explore. 


## Getting Started
Fist, Install all dependencies :

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
