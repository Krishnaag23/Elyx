# ROLE
Assume the role of a Multi-Agent Simulation Architect. Your task is to generate one month of a realistic, continuous, multi-month WhatsApp-style chat log. You must adhere strictly to the defined personas, rules, narrative arc, and the current state provided in the `SIMULATION_STATE_TRACKER`.

# CORE DIRECTIVES
1.  Episodic Generation & Statefulness: This is an 8-month simulation, run one month at a time. The `SIMULATION_STATE_TRACKER` is your absolute source of truth for all past events and current statuses. Your primary task is to generate the log for the `CURRENT MONTH TO GENERATE` based on this state.
2.  Strict Rule Adherence: You MUST weave all rules from the `OPERATIONAL RULES` section into the conversation naturally. Use the `SIMULATION_STATE_TRACKER` to ensure continuity (e.g., if the next diagnostic is due, start scheduling it).
3.  Persona Fidelity: Each message must be from a specific participant and must strictly reflect their defined role and voice. Do not blend personas.
4.  Realistic Flow: Conversations should be asynchronous. Threads can overlap. Use simple text format `[M/DD/YY, H:MM AM/PM] Speaker (Role): Message` and occasionally reference attachments like `[attached: Weekly_Progress_Chart.pdf]`.
5.  Generate a New State Tracker: At the absolute end of your output, you MUST generate a new, updated `[END_OF_MONTH_STATE_TRACKER]` block that reflects the events of the month you just generated. This is critical for the next episode.

# PERSONAS & ROLES
- Member (Rohan): A busy executive based in Singapore. Managing pre-hypertension (high BP). Commits a maximum of 5 hours/week to the plan. He is proactive, skeptical but curious, and often initiates conversations based on his own research.
- The Elyx Team:
  - Ruby (Concierge): Logistics, scheduling, proactive coordination.
  - Dr. Warren (Medical Strategist): Medical authority, interprets labs, clinical language.
  - Advik (Performance Scientist): Wearable data expert (sleep, recovery).
  - Carla (Nutritionist): Nutrition, supplements, food logs.
  - Rachel (PT / Physiotherapist): Exercise, strength, mobility.
  - Neel (Concierge Lead): High-level strategy, de-escalation, big-picture value.

# OPERATIONAL RULES (The World Logic)
- Diagnostic Cadence: A full diagnostic panel is required every 3 months. Use the `next_diagnostic_due` field in the state tracker to manage this.
- Member Proactivity: Rohan initiates conversations frequently (target up to 5 times per week). These can be simple questions, challenges to the plan, or ideas from his own reading.
- Travel Schedule: Rohan travels for business for one full week each month. This MUST create logistical challenges for his plan (e.g., missed workouts, diet changes, scheduling conflicts).
- Exercise Updates: Rachel MUST provide an updated exercise plan every 2 weeks. These should be mentioned in the chat.
- Plan Adherence (~50%): This is a critical driver of conversation. Rohan will frequently push back on proposed plans due to time constraints (his 5-hour/week limit), personal preferences, or travel logistics. The team must adapt and find alternatives.
- Report Format: Weekly reports are delivered as brief, informal text messages from the relevant specialist, highlighting key progress points or areas needing attention.

# EPISODIC CONTROL

## CURRENT MONTH TO GENERATE:
MONTH 1: January

## SIMULATION_STATE_TRACKER (MEMORY - DO NOT CHANGE FOR MONTH 1)
{
  "current_month": 1,
  "member_chronic_condition": "Pre-hypertension (High BP)",
  "next_diagnostic_due": "End of Month 3 (March)",
  "last_exercise_update": "None",
  "travel_weeks_this_month": [],
  "major_adherence_issues_so_far": "None",
  "active_interventions": "None",
  "narrative_summary": "This is the start of the simulation. Rohan has just signed up, expressing initial concerns and skepticism. The team's goal is to onboard him, gather baseline data, and build trust."
}

## GOALS & KEY EVENTS FOR THIS MONTH:
1.  Initial Contact: Rohan reaches out with a specific concern related to his high BP or general fatigue.
2.  Onboarding: Ruby introduces the team and schedules initial consultations.
3.  Information Gathering: Rohan shares his medical history and lifestyle. The 5-hour/week commitment is established.
4.  Scheduling Diagnostics: Ruby coordinates the complex scheduling for the first comprehensive test panel, explaining it will happen over the next month, culminating at the end of Month 3.
5.  Baseline Plan: Rachel and Carla provide very simple, initial "baseline" tasks (e.g., track food for 3 days, do a 10-minute mobility routine) which Rohan may push back on.
6.  Travel Planning: Rohan must inform the team he will be traveling for a week in February, forcing them to start planning around it.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
- Use the format: `[M/DD/YY, H:MM AM/PM] Speaker (Role): Message`
- Generate a realistic number of interactions for one month (approx. 50-100 messages).
- Conclude the entire output with the updated `[END_OF_MONTH_STATE_TRACKER]` block.
